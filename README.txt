We intercepted the syscall2 in a very similar way as in Phase 1 of this homework. When it came to the actual syscall function our fields included: target Pid, empty ancestry struct and then we copy from the user the neccessary elements and then stich the find_vpid() struct into the found vip task struct, and finally went into the said struct and looked at its children filled up the struct, looked at the siblings, filled up the struct and looked at the ancestors and filled up the struct. For the testing section of part 2 we used scanf() to check the pid, and then checked that init was 1 then we checked, because we could see the pid's in the syslog, to see if a value that wasn't there would show up. We tested the Syscall1 by using the cat function in the terminal to open read and close files.
